! NOTES:  
! Because the JPL database includes hfs, we have recomputed the entire
! spectrum (without hfs) with the accurate constants of Niedenhoff et al.
! (1995, J. Mol. Spectrosc., 174, 151).  For the lower transitions, these
! frequencies and transition probabilities agree with the weighted mean
! values tabulated in the JPL database well within the uncertainties.
! The same values of the dipole moments have been used as in the JPL
! tables, namely mu_a=1.602 and mu_b=1.350 Debye.
! The collision rates have been recomputed through use of S. Green's
! program for a larger number of levels than were included in his 
! example.  The recommended temperature range for these rates is 30-250 K.
! This data set could, in principle, be extended to higher states;
! however, owing to the large transition probabilities that connect 
! states with K_a>3 to low-lying states, the populations of higher states
! are likely to be controlled by radiative processes and not collisions
! in most astrophysical environments of interest.
